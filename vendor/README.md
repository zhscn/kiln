# Vendored modules

Copies of SICL-ecosystem modules that kiln patches. Each is imported
unmodified in its own commit (the upstream commit is recorded below), and
kiln's changes follow in separate commits, so `git log -- vendor/NAME`
shows exactly what kiln changed. Changes are not sent upstream for now.

## Clostrophilia patches

Each patched place is marked with a `kiln:` comment.

- `*class-unique-number*` is a `defvar`: the bootstrap numbers the braid's
  classes before `initialize-instance-defmethods.lisp` is loaded.
- The `(setf documentation)` of `add-method` is not evaluated
  (Clostrophilia's `documentation` takes one object; no `format` yet).
- No `compile` at run time (kiln has no compiler at run time before M5):
  the discriminating function interprets the discriminating automaton
  (binary search over stamp intervals per layer) instead of compiling a
  `tagbody`; effective method forms are interpreted into closures
  (`call-method`, `make-method`, `progn`, `multiple-value-prog1`, `if`,
  `quote`, `and`, `or` and calls to global functions); accessor method
  functions are closures.
- `default-discriminating-function` checks for obsolete instances (stamp
  differs from the class's unique number) and updates them before
  dispatching again, as its comment describes.
- The standard method combination does not require primary methods: an
  effective method without them signals an error only if the primary
  methods are reached (an `:around` method need not call
  `call-next-method`; Predicament's `signal` on a symbol relies on it).
